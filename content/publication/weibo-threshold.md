We test the threshold hypothesis of social influence with a large dataset of information diffusion on social media. There exists a bell-shaped relationship between social influence and diffusion size. However, the large network threshold, limited diffusion depth and intense bursts become the bottlenecks that constrain the diffusion size. The practice of viral marketing needs innovative strategies to increase information novelty and reduce the excessive network threshold. In all, this research extends threshold models of social influence and underlines the nonlinear nature of social influence in information diffusion."

> Social influence plays a key role in determining the size of information diffusion. We test this hypothesis using a large dataset of information diffusion on social media. It finds that large network threshold, limited diffusion depth, and strong bursts become the bottlenecks that constrain online information diffusion.

## Keywords

Information Diffusion; Collective Gatekeeping; Interpersonal Effects; Bandwagon Effects; Threshold Model

The results demonstrate that the bandwagon of collective gatekeepers is the primary driver for online news diffusion. Interestingly, the bandwagon effect of collective gatekeeping is moderated by the strength of interpersonal effects. The theoretical generalizations of this research contribute to our understanding about the impact of collective gatekeeping on information diffusion.

## Highlights

1. Drawing on threshold models to capture the interpersonal effects and collective gatekeeping, we test our hypothesis with two novel datasets of information diffusion on social media.
2. The findings demonstrate that both bandwagon effect and interpersonal effect play important roles in collective gatekeeping on social media.
3. The bandwagon of collective gatekeepers is the primary driver for online news diffusion
4. The bandwagon effect of collective gatekeeping is moderated by the strength of interpersonal effects.
